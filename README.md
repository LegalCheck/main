## Can the law help me?

Can the law help me? is a legal check tool created for Community Law during the [Charity-IT Hackathon](http://www.charity-it.org/2017-hackathon-wellington/), 17-19 March 2017.  

Most of the time, people don’t realise that a lawyer could help with things like debts, housing, employment or all the other stuff in life somewhere represented in our country’s law.
Community Law wants to help people be able to identify if a lawyer could help – and that they could get free legal advice if something is wrong. 

The legal checkup site is a simple way for Community workers and anyone to self-diagnose if they could be facing legal problems and if a lawyer might be able to help them.

The legal checkup site - Can the Law Help Me? is created using React framework with NodeJS backend.
